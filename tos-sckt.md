## üìú 1. Description of the Tool

The Star Citizen Kill Tracker is a third-party software application designed to enhance the Star Citizen gameplay experience. The Tool functions by reading the Game.log file generated by the Star Citizen client to track player-versus-player (PvP) and player-versus-environment (PvE) events. This information is then processed by the Tool's centralized system and relayed to designated Discord channels.

This Tool is an independent, community-developed project and is **not** endorsed by, affiliated with, or otherwise associated with Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) or Discord Inc.

## üì° 2. Webhook and Data Relay Service

The Tool utilizes a centralized webhook management system, herein referred to as **‚ÄúSC Kill Tracker Systems.‚Äù** This system is solely responsible for managing all data transmission from the Tool to the Discord platform.

- **Centralized Management:** All data relay webhooks are owned, managed, and maintained by the SC Kill Tracker Systems. Standard users cannot provide, modify, or change the destination webhooks.
- **User & Organization Relays:** The ability to transmit data to a specific, non-public Discord server is a privileged feature. This is available only to users who have been formally approved and granted ‚ÄúUser Relay‚Äù or ‚ÄúOrganization (Org) Relay‚Äù status by the developer. Users with Relay status are responsible for ensuring their designated Discord channel complies with all relevant terms and policies.
