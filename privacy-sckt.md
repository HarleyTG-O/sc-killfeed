# Star Citizen Kill Tracker – Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** July 11, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the Star Citizen Kill Tracker (the “Tool”) and its associated systems collect, use, and handle data. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to transparency in our data practices. By using the Tool, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 📊 1. Data Collection

The Tool and its systems collect two categories of data:

- **In-Game Event Data:**  
  The Tool functions by passively reading the Game.log file generated by the Star Citizen client on your local machine. No data is collected that is not present in this log file. The specific data points parsed may include:  
  - Victim and aggressor in-game character names.  
  - Event timestamps.  
  - In-game location names (e.g., planets, zones).  
  - Weapon or instrument used in the event.  
  - Classification of the event (e.g., PvP, PvE).

- **System Access Logs:**  
  To maintain the security and stability of our services, we automatically collect basic login and logout data when you use the Tool or access our websites. This may include timestamps and IP addresses.

> **Note:** None of this data is considered Personally Identifiable Information (PII) unless you have chosen to include personal information (such as your real name) in your Star Citizen character name.

## ⚙️ 2. Data Processing and Transmission

The data collected by the local Tool is transmitted to the centralized **“SC Kill Tracker Systems”** for processing.

- **In-Memory Processing:**  
  All in-game event data is processed in-memory by our central system for the sole purpose of formatting and relaying it to the appropriate Discord channel.

- **Data Relay:**  
  The processed event data is then sent to Discord via webhooks managed exclusively by the SC Kill Tracker Systems. Standard users do not have access to these webhooks. Users with approved “User Relay” or “Organization (Org) Relay” status will have their data relayed to their designated Discord channels.

## 💾 3. Data Storage

We are committed to minimizing data retention.

- **Local Tool:**  
  The Tool installed on your computer does **not** store any user data, event history, or logs.

- **Central Systems:**  
  The SC Kill Tracker Systems do **not** store historical in-game event data. Information related to kills and deaths is processed ephemerally and is discarded after being successfully relayed to Discord. However, to ensure system security and stability, we do retain System Access Logs for a limited period. These logs are used exclusively for troubleshooting and security monitoring and are not shared with third parties.

## 🔗 4. Third-Party Services

The only external service the Tool and its systems interact with is **Discord Inc.,** for the purpose of relaying event information. We do not include any third-party analytics, tracking cookies, or software development kits (SDKs) in the Tool.

## 👤 5. User Responsibility

By using the Tool, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

- You will comply with Discord’s Terms of Service.
- You understand that your in-game actions will be transmitted by the Tool.
- If you are concerned about privacy, you will avoid including personally sensitive information in your in-game character name.

## 🔄 6. Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy and updating the **Effective Date** at the top of this document. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
