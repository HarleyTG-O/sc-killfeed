# 📄 Privacy Policy  
**Effective Date:** April 30, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes the data collected by the **Star Citizen Kill Tracker** (the "Tool") and how that data is used.

---

## 1. 🔍 Data Collected

The Tool passively reads in-game death events from the `Game.log` file generated by **Star Citizen**. The following data points may be parsed:

- Victim and killer usernames
- Event timestamps
- Zone or location names
- Weapon used
- Damage type classification

> ⚠️ None of this data is personally identifiable unless your in-game name includes personal information.

---

## 2. 📤 Discord Webhook Usage

The Tool transmits event data to a **Discord webhook URL** provided by the user. Webhook payloads may include:

- Type of death (PvP or PvE)
- Structured embed content (e.g., victim name, killer name, zone, weapon, etc.)

You are solely responsible for the creation, security, and management of your webhook endpoint.

---

## 3. 💾 Data Storage

- The Tool **does not store** any user data, event history, or logs on disk or on any remote servers.
- All data is processed in-memory and discarded after the webhook transmission.

---

## 4. 🌐 Third-Party Services

- The only external service utilized is **Discord**, via webhook integration.
- No analytics, tracking cookies, or third-party SDKs are included in this Tool.

---

## 5. 🛡️ User Responsibility

By using the Tool, you agree to:

- Comply with [Discord’s Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) when configuring or using webhooks.
- Use separate webhook URLs for testing or private environments to avoid unintended data sharing.
- Avoid including personally sensitive information in in-game names if privacy is a concern.
